## Description

Minesweeper is a classic game where the objective is to reveal all cells on a board without triggering hidden mines. The game offers three difficulty levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. As you reveal cells, the number in each cell indicates the number of adjacent mines. Clicking on a mine ends the game, and all mines are revealed.

### Background Information

This project was created to practice skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and to learn about creating interactive web-based games. The Minesweeper game was chosen for its simplicity and as a great exercise to apply programming logic and interface design.
